# pybbbc
This is a python interface to the BBBC021 dataset of cellular images ([Caie et al., Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1148)), available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection ([Ljosa et al., Nature Methods, 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2083)).

The images are of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated for 24 h with a collection of 113 small molecules at eight concentrations. The cells were fixed, labeled for DNA, F-actin, and Î’-tubulin, and imaged by fluorescent microscopy. The complete description of the dataset can be found [here](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC021).

The raw data (13,200 fields of view imaged in three channels) can be downloaded after importing the BBBC021 dataset as follows:
```python
from pybbbc import BBBC021
BBBC021.download_raw_data()
```
This will automatically create the data folder in the current working directory and download images and metadata (this may take several hours). Alternatively, it is possible to specify the ```data_path``` parameter to set the destination folder.

After downloading the raw data, the preprocessed dataset can be created by calling ```BBBC021.make_dataset()```. This function will execute the following steps:
* Merge the metadata regarding the compound and the Mechanism of Action (MoA)
* Compute and apply the illumination correction function to the images
* Scale pixel intensities in the \[0, 1\] range discarding the top and bottom 0.1 percentiles
* Create a virtual HDFS dataset (using h5py) associating the images to the corresponding metadata

In order to compute the illumination correction function an image is created, consisting of the average of all the images taken at the same site and belonging to the same plate. This image is then smoothed using a Gaussian filter with sigma=500. A robust minimum is calculated as the 0.02 percentile of all the positive values of the average image, and all the pixel with smaller values are truncated. This image is finally divided by the robust minimum in order to have only values greater or equal to one so that the illumination correction can be applied by dividing the original image by the illumination function.

```python
def correct_illumination(images, sigma=500, min_percentile=0.02):
    img_avg = images.mean(axis=0)
    img_mask = gaussian_filter(img_avg, sigma=sigma)
    robust_min = np.percentile(img_mask[img_mask > 0], min_percentile)
    img_mask[img_mask < robust_min] = robust_min
    img_mask = img_mask / robust_min
    return images / img_mask
```
